Fairytiles (2013)

![fairytiles](../images/fairytile.png)

- A Unity 3D Game for iOS and Android I developed for Crazy Monkey Studios. The goal of the game is to clear the field of characters. You have to make groups of 5 or more characters of the same color. Once the characters are grouped, you score points, and the grouped characters vanish, making more room for new maneuvers.
- Contribution: 100%.
